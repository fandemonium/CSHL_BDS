Biological science has entered the era of big data. Since the commercialization of next-generation sequencing technology, the development of computational hardware could no longer follow the rapidly increasing data analysis needs. It is also more and more apparent to scientists that efficiently utlizing computational resources is essential for generating reproducible data and collaborating with experts in other disciplines. Many conventional graphic user interfaced softwares are not sustainable for that they could not be easily integrated with big data or meet the multi-disciplinary requirements. Hence, big data analysis became the bottle necks of many biological researches. 

Software Carpentry (SWC), part of the Mozilla Science Lab, introduces efficient and sustainable scientific computing to the broad scientific community. The goal of SWC is to teach scientists basic computing skills, including how to build, use, validate and share softwares to make scientists more productive and produce more reliable and repeatable results. We run two-day intensive training courses focus on using basic structural programs to manipulate data (e.g., Python), tracking changes in version control (e.g., Git), evaluating and debugging scripts, and automating the data analysis process. All of the tools we teach are open sourced and teaching materials are openly available. Most importantly, we also use the tools we teach to store and maintain the teaching materials and demonstrate how these tools could be useful in scientific research. 

SWC trains scientists to teach scientists. As a volunteer organization, SWC has instructors from various disciplines and many are SWC alumni. The instructor's science background is helpfulwhen communicating with our audience. This is also instrumental for the audience to relate theusefulness of the skills they freshly learned. We expect to develop a positive learning experience and lead to a chain reaction in spreading sustainable scientific computing.
